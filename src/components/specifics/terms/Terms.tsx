      <h1>Terms of application</h1>
      <p>
        You may use 30 days plank challenge (30d) but 30d is basically personal
        application. As such, 30d may change from time to time. We may stop
        providing 30d to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may revise these Terms from time to time. The changes will not be
        retroactive, and the most current version of the Terms will govern our
        relationship with you.
      </p>
      <h2 id="privacy">Privacy policy</h2>
      <p>
        When you use 30d, we receive some personal information from you like the
        type of device youâ€™re using and your IP address. They are usually used
        to fix application errors but may be used for advertising in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        We use <a href="https://firebase.google.com/">Firebase</a> for
        application hosting and authentication. Please check the official
        website for the service.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have questions about this policy, how we collect or process your
        personal data, or anything else related to our privacy practices, we
        want to hear from you. You can{' '}
